# Every person should be allocated exactly one laptop.
# If we define “sadness” as the number of places down in someone’s ranking the operating system the ended up with (i.e. if your preferences were [UBUNTU, ARCH, MACOS] and you were allocated a MACOS machine your sadness would be 2), we want to minimise the total sadness of all people. If we allocate someone a laptop with an operating system not in their preferred list, treat them as having a sadness of 100.
