# Exercise
# Add the is_adult code to the file you saved earlier.

# Run it through mypy - notice that no errors are reported - mypy understands that Person has a property named age so is happy with the function.

# Write a new function in the file that accepts a Person as a parameter and tries to access a property that doesn’t exist. Run it through mypy and check that it does report an error.
def print_address(person: Person) -> None:
    print(person.address)

    # bug: Person has no attribute 'address' - mypy will report this error when we run it.
